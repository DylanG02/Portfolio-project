# Portfolio-project

My Personal Portfolio page that shows of some of the applications and web sites I have made and shows off some of the skills I have used to create them 

## Description: 

A simple page showcasing some of the projects I have made with links to the github repository for each one allowing people to view the code.

## Improvements:

Update it with projects I create in the future, create a pop up when clicking on each of the projects images to show a short description of each rather than having to find it on github.
